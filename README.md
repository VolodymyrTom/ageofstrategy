Age of Strategy: A Never-Before NFT+Blind Box Strategic SLG GameFi

GameFi, a fusion of Game and DeFi, its core value lies in integrating the financial element into the game, which enhances the game economy through financial attributes while promoting them through the game, forming a dynamic balance and internal circulation. Moreover, GameFi operates on a Play to Earn (P2E) model which attracts and incentivizes players.

DeFi is an inseparable component of GameFi and it enriches the gameplay and playability in the form of NFT game assets, liquidity mining and so on. Besides Play to Earn, GameFi opens a window to the world of Metaverse for the realistic world. This is highly favored by the capitals. They swarm into this market and make GameFi the next outlet of blockchain technology with innumerous economic and investment values.
Such attention from the capitals comes with the goods and bads. Some GameFi projects were launched for the sake of launching. The essence of “game” was overlooked. However on a global scale, many projects with great potential are coming into the light.

# BATTLE MODE
Age of Strategy is a classic yet unique turn-based SLG based on blockchain technology with 4 battle modes including PVE, PVP, GVG, and AVA. The game is designed with the application of P2E and token economy, aiming to build a "GameFi + DeFi + NFT + DAO + Blind Box" ecosystem in the grand Metaverse.

Players of Age of Strategy will be incentivized and rewarded by the blind boxes game mechanism. They can collect different NFT Heroes by opening blind boxes, and these NFT Heroes all come in with unique skills. By forming a team of 3 heroes, players can enter the PVE, PVP, GVG or AVA battle, and play strategically to earn. In Age of Strategy players are challenged to think and plan strategically in order to win a battle. This largely increases the playability of the game and grants different levels of satisfaction to the players.

# NFT
The NFT Heroes in Age of Strategy come in different rarity scales: Normal, Rare, Super Rare, Superior Super Rare and Ultra Rare. Players will initially obtain the heroes by opening blind boxes and from special events. Later the Heroes can be bought and sold at the NFT trade market. The rarer the Heroes, the smaller the amount and the higher the damage points.

By design, the NFT Heroes in Age of Strategy can not only wear a variety of skills and weapons, but also upgrade to higher levels as the game proceeds. Players are granted the ownership of their game assets. They can earn ASR from the game or sell their NFTs for ASR to join Farms and to buy NFT game props. While driven by the token and NFT rewards, players will also gain the sense of conquering and accomplishment. 

Age of Strategy runs on a bi-token economy model. AS, the core token, can be used for staking with calculated APY. Players can also use AS to get blind boxes with NFT Heroes, Skills and Weapons, and Level Up Potion and Food. When players build the NFT, half of all AS spent will be directly destroyed, and the other half will enter the reward pool that will later be given back to the players.

On the other hand, ASR, the game token, is 100% produced and mainly used in the game. Players can use ASR for staking to collect game props such as the Level Up Potion and Food. Given the consumptive nature of the NFT game props, it attracts players to use ASR for staking and as a result, reduces its amount on the market. Players can use ASR to not only purchase NFT Heroes, Skills, Weapons, and Farms on the NFT trade market, but also exchange for rare blind boxes in the game.
In comparison with AS, half of all ASR spent will be directly destroyed, and the other half will enter the reward pool which will later be given back to the players, creating deflation and internal recycle of ASR.

Professionally designed, original gameplay, and great interactions among players. Age of Strategy is going to open a new era of GameFi. Stay tuned for the upcoming launch!
